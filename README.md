## How to Use

1. **Select Your Stack**: Choose your primary development area (Frontend, Mobile, Backend, or DevOps)

2. **Rate Your Skills**: For each skill in your selected stack, choose your seniority level:
   - Level 1: Trainee - Learning fundamentals
   - Level 2: Junior - Basic implementation
   - Level 3: SSR - Semi-Senior, independent work
   - Level 4: Senior - Advanced, mentoring others
   - Level 5: Expert - Architecture and leadership

3. **View Your Ranking**: The system calculates your overall seniority score and displays:
   - Numerical score (0-100)
   - Seniority level
   - Description of your level
   - Your strongest skills

## Ranking Algorithm

The ranking is calculated using a weighted average approach:
- Each skill level (1-5) contributes to the total score
- The average is normalized to a 0-100 scale
- Ranking ranges determine your overall seniority level
